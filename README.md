## Proving Ground: Towards Computers as Mathematical Collaborators



A collection of tools built towards the ultimate goal of computers becoming *collaborators* rather than *assistants* for doing Mathematics. Along the way, we hope that this becomes a collection of tools to increase productivity while doing mathematics.

At present, some of the components, in early stages of deve are:

* Translating mathematical prose to the underlying logic and actions.

* Models for underlying logic and theories.

* A general *aware* task system that invokes resources for tasks, records partial and complete solutions and controls workflow. This is intended to be a *resourceful* system following ideas of Marvin Minsky.

* Generic evolvers for making unbounded searches.

* *Actor* interfaces for making unbounded searches in incremental steps without blocking.
