## Proving Ground: Towards Computers as Mathematical CollaboratorsA collection of tools built towards the ultimate goal of computers becoming *collaborators* rather than *assistants* for doing Mathematics, based on *unsupervised learning* of mathematics using natural language processing, exploration and experimentation.At present, some of the components, in early stages of developement are:* Translating mathematical prose to the underlying logic and actions. These are based on the Stanford dependency parser.* Homotopy type theory foundations* Parsing expressions and prose into homotopy type theory.* Models for underlying logic and theories.* A general *aware* task system that invokes resources for tasks, records partial and complete solutions and controls workflow. This is intended to be a *resourceful* system following ideas of Marvin Minsky.* Generic evolvers and dynamics for making unbounded searches.* *Actor* interfaces for making unbounded searches in incremental steps without blocking, with example applications for factorising integers.
