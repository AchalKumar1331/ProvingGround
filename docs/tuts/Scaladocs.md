The links below are deprecated - unidoc is used to generate [Scaladocs]({{site.baseurl}}unidoc/provingground/index.html)


Proving-ground has a multi-project build. The [core](core/api) project has code that can run on both the  JVM and ScalaJS, and is the best starting point for browsing the scaladocs (or code)

* [andrewscurtis](andrewscurtis/api/) : experiments from some years ago using learning for the Andrews-Curtis conjecture.
* [client](client/api/) : the scala-js interface.
* [core](core/api/) : Homotopy type theory, learning, functorial translation etc.
* [exploring](exploring/api/) : for packaging for experimental runs.
* [mantle](mantle/api/) : the main JVM specific code.
* [mizar](mizar/api/) : a partial parser from Mizar.
* [nlp](nlp/api/) : use of natural language processing.
* [normalform](normalform/api/) : old code for  symbolic algebra.
* [realfunctions](realfunctions/api/) : for proving with exact arithmetic.
