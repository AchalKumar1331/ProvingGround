When exploring starting with `A, B`, the best proofs discovered are not the _atomic_ ones, but composite ones such as a _double constant_, with type $A \\to B \\to B \\to A$. This is correct, but ideally should be avoided.

This can be avoided by giving a greater weight to _absolute_ entropy of the statement, for example using $p / q (log(q))^2$.
